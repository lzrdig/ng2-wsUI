# ng2-wsUI
Angular4 client side UI for weather station

AngularCLI is used (with embedded Webpack).
Some simplistic features have implemented to display data from a FineOffset weather station.
History data is to be displayed through the use of Chartist.
Currently no async data retrieval is in place. The data provisioning is emulated.
